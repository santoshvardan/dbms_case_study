To create an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram and relational schema for an online shopping website, we'll define a basic structure with entities like Product, Category, and Customer. Let's also include relationships such as "Product belongs to a Category" and "Customer makes a Purchase". The schema will use a simplified notation.

Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram:

  +-----------+   belongs to    +-----------+
  |           |<--------------| |           |
  |  Product  |               | | Category  |
  |           |--------------->|           |
  +-----------+   has many     +-----------+
           |                        |
           | makes a                | contains
           |                        |
  +--------|--------+   +-----------|-----------+
  |                 |   |                       |
  |    Purchase     |   |       Customer        |
  |                 |   |                       |
  +-----------------+   +-----------------------+
In this ER diagram:

Product has a many-to-one relationship with Category as a product belongs to a category.
Customer has a one-to-many relationship with Purchase as a customer can make many purchases.
Product and Category have a many-to-many relationship.
Relational Schema:
Based on the ER diagram, we can derive a relational schema.

Product:

ProductID (PK)
ProductName
Description
Price
Category:

CategoryID (PK)
CategoryName
Customer:

CustomerID (PK)
FirstName
LastName
Email
Purchase:

PurchaseID (PK)
ProductID (FK)
CustomerID (FK)
PurchaseDate
The foreign keys (FK) in the Purchase table reference the primary keys (PK) of the Product and Customer tables, establishing the relationships.

This is a simple representation and might not cover all aspects of a real-world online shopping system. Adjust and expand the schema based on the specific requirements and functionalities of your application.
